# Natural Disaster Data Exploration Dashboard

## Introduction

This project uses Python and Dash to explore data about natural disasters from 1950 to 2020. The data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and it contains information about volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. 

## File Descriptions

***volerup:*** Volcano data.

***signif.txt.tsv:*** Earthquake data.

***tsevent.txt.tsv:*** Tsunami data.

***InteractiveDashboard.pdf:*** PDF file of the dashboard.

***InteractiveDashboard.ipynb:*** Code for creating the graphs and dash app.

## View Graphs

Plotly charts do not display on GitHub. Charts can be viewed by going to  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and inputting the URL of the project. 

## View Dashboard

Run the code in *InteractiveDashboard.ipynb* and click on the link outputted by cell 53 to see the dashboard. 

## Improvements

- Use tool to develop the app
- Make separate pages for each subtopic (Volcanoes, Earthquakes, Tsunamis)
